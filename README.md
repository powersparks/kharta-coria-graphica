# Inception Phase: Kharta Coria Graphica
## Introduction
This solution is not ready for use, with fundamental components or framework needing to be coded. The inception phase will complete a Telligent Plugin for Containers, Applications, and Contents (Telligent Content Model). Transitioning soon into an Elaboration Phase, which will code a Kharta container types for different discipline data sets and offer admin or management panel tools. The Group containers will be supported with their own Applications for Sources, data viewers, analysis models, data conversion, and presentation tools. Contents for Maps, Tables, and Charts will be easily embed in pages or applications (blogs, wikis, media, forums).
## Description And Capabilities
Kharta Coria Graphic is a Telligent Community Plugin and a Visual Studio solution.  Kharta, as in a table, chart or map, is both for understanding aspatial and spatial phenomena.  Coria, as in skin or a presentation wrapper, is named such to denote the use of libraries that help deliver compelling graphics, e.g., d3.js, Google Maps Api, MapBox, ArcGIS or others.  Graphica, as in data visualization, is the process of extracting implicit knowledge in data as explicit information.  Kharta manages the data sources which live either externally on the web, as data services, or internally, as part of the robust "Telligent Community" framework family of applications (blogs, forums, wikis, and media galleries (images, text files, csv, etc.) or as RESTful data services, e.g., searching for Telligent Community Content.  Coria interfaces different JavaScript APIs with data sources, provided by the Kharta data management applications.  Coria provides the rules used by the Graphica  plugin to template and assemble Coria components and Telligent widgets, enabling users to apply complex geospatial analysis with compelling interactive graphics.
## Inception Phase Concept Design
This concept design is still evolving, and maybe to soon. More thought in context with 2005 Wilkinson's Grammer of Graphics: Statistics and Computing is needed. However, the overall design will be in concert with the Telligent Community paradigm, so getting a this first version in place should be able to contribute to the final product easily enough.  With this in mind, here is a preliminary Concept Design:
