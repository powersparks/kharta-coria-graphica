# Inception Phase: Kharta Coria Graphica
## Introduction
This solution is not ready for use, with fundamental components or framework needing to be coded. The inception phase will complete a Telligent Plugin for Containers, Applications, and Contents (Telligent Content Model as Content Types). Transitioning soon into an Elaboration Phase, which may code a Kharta container types for different discipline data sets and offer admin or management panel tools. The Group containers will be supported with their own Applications for Sources, data viewers, analysis models, data conversion, and presentation tools. Contents for Maps, Tables, and Charts will be easily embed in pages or applications (blogs, wikis, media, forums).
## Description And Capabilities
Kharta Coria Graphic (KCG) is a Telligent Community Plugin, a Visual Studio solution, EF 6 to access Sql Server.  Kharta, is beneath a table, chart, graph, map, or report; all for understanding aspatial and spatial phenomena thru a staging of sources, and is a starting point for users to form a recipe.  Coria, as in skin or a presentation wrapper, is named such to denote the use of libraries that help deliver compelling graphics, e.g., d3.js, Google Maps Api, MapBox, ArcGIS or others.  Graphica, as in data visualization, is the process of extracting implicit knowledge in data as explicit information.  Kharta manages the data sources which live either externally on the web, as data services, or internally, as part of the robust "Telligent Community" framework family of applications (blogs, forums, wikis, and media galleries (images, text files, csv, etc.) or as RESTful data services, e.g., searching for Telligent Community Content.  Coria interfaces different JavaScript APIs with data sources, provided by the Kharta data management applications.  Graphica provides the rules used to create an application of data and viewers. KCG are plugins using data, models, recipes, and templates assembled as components and Telligent widgets, enabling users to apply complex geospatial analysis with compelling interactive graphics.
## Inception Phase Concept Design
This concept design is still evolving, as such, this preview may change. As an abstract, it seems right, although after more thought in context with 2005 Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics: Statistics and Computing, a more concise way forward should appear. However, the overall design will be in concert with the Telligent Community paradigm, so this first version should be able to contribute to the final product easily enough.  With this in mind, here is a preliminary Concept Design:
## Kharta Coria Graphica Concept
Because KCG plugs into Telligent's Community or "Social" website, a review of Telligent's content model, core services, and extensibility model are needed.
