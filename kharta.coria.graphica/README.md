# Kharta Coria Graphica Library
Primary purpose for this dll is the EF 6 data model and any utilities that need to be used for all three projects.
## Data Model
Entity Framework 6 provides a "Code First" Wizard, which assist in either creating a diagram, classes, or tables. I feel the data model diagrams add alot of bulk to the project. As the data model becomes more sophisticated, e.g. adding in relationships or more models, a digram is going to be needed. At this point, KhartaDataModel.cs and a class for each table is provided. Adding tables is pretty straight forward... and if needed a tutorial here might be needed
